# temporal-migration

This repository aims to provide support for self-hosted Temporal users that should migrate to [Temporal Cloud](https://temporal.io/cloud).

It contains reusable libraries and components along with examples demonstrating their usage. Further, a Simulator is
included to help you see how the Push/Pull approach of continuing Workflow Executions in another Namespace works.


*Java SDK support* is [here](/java).
